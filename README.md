<h1>PacMen Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This program generates a new pacman every time the user clicks the "Add PacMan" button. Using some basic html buttons, a pacman image and Javascript, we create a new pacman on click, and move it around the screen with a set velocity. We also set boundaries based on screen dimensions so each pacman can bounce back when they make contact with a wall. 

<h2>Instructions on how to run</h2>

All you have to do to run this app is git clone this repo and open up the index.html file on your favorite browser. Alternatively you could run this appliaction live on my website : https://bustamad12320.github.io/PacMen/ .

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

1. Add collision between each pacman

2. Animate each pacman's movement further using more images
